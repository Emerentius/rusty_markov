# Markov chain

A markov chain I wrote with nearly no previous knowledge of markov chains, written on a lazy friday. Use at own risk.

# Usage

First you need [rust](https://rustup.rs/).

If `memory.zip` is not found, the script will try to generate it from a file called `logs.txt`. The script assumes that the logfile is newline seperated, and each line starts with `>`. The bot will only parse the text after `>`, and will ignore the line if `>` is not found.

Afterwards the script will load `memory.zip`.

Additional learning data can be added by calling `memory.learn(line: &str)`. A response can be generated by calling `memory.speak(starting_word: &str)`

For large log files (mine was 18MB), it is recommended to run this in release mode.
